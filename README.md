## Getting Started

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using IO.Swagger.Api;

using Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class Example
    {
        public void main()
        {
            
            var apiInstance = new AccountingCodesApi();
            var acId = acId_example;  // string | ID of the accounting code you want to delete.

            try
            {
                // Delete accounting code
                CommonResponseType result = apiInstance.DELETEAccountingCode(acId);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling AccountingCodesApi.DELETEAccountingCode: " + e.Message );
